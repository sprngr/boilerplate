# boilerplate

> A collection of starter projects & templates

This mono repo contains useful templates to help launch new projects. At its core it is intended to be as lean as possible with little to no dependencies to utilize any of the templates contained within.

## Usage

The simplest usage of this project is to curl and untar contents directly to your existing or new project directory.

Replace the value at the end with the name of the directory you wish to copy.

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/sprngr/boilerplate/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=2 boilerplate-master/TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY
```

Alternatively, clone yourself a copy of the repo to copy out contents as needed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sprngr/boilerplate.git
```

You can also [download a zip](https://github.com/sprngr/boilerplate/archive/master.zip) and avoid the command line all together.

### README

The available [README](/readme/README.md) template is based off [RichardLitt/standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme), [noffle/common-readme](https://github.com/noffle/common-readme), & others to form a reasonable default. 

See the [standard-readme spec](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md) for suggestions on what you may want to fill out.
